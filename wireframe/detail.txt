In this project, users will be able to create different characters 
with different values being added by them. 
For example, each value can be the 
character's name, height, age, eye color and it will be placed on a table.
They can then look at other characters that different users have made, 
create another one, edit one they made, or delete it. 

As for extra additions:
I would like to add more form types to the characters like descriptions for
the character.
I would like to make another page for viewing more in depth detail of the character.
I would like to have the table be able to sort itself alphabetically, by age, by height, or by creator.
